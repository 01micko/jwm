.SH CONFIGURATION
.B OVERVIEW
.RS
Configureation of JWM is done by editing ".jwmrc".  This file is XML
making it easy to edit, either by hand or programmatically. The
example.jwmrc gives an example configuration file which specifies all the
options.  Before restarting JWM, it is a good idea to run "jwm -p" to make
sure the configuration file is free of errors.  Otherwise you may end up
without a root menu.

Icons for windows that don't supply an icon via the _NET_WM_ICON hint are

(minus the ".xpm" extension) matches the instance name of the window as
returned in the WM_CLASS hint. If this lookup fails, a default icon is
supplied. This icon will be displayed for the window on it's title bar and
on the task bar. Icons that are not an appropriate size as determined by
taking the minimum of the title bar height and the tray height will be scaled.  Square icons work best.
.P
For menu items, the icon path is searched for a match. the icon specified for
a menu item must be the exact name of the icon file with the extension.
If no match is found, a blank area will appear where the icon should appear.
If an icon is not specified for any menu item in a menu, no space will be
allocated for icons.
.P
Icon properties are contained within the \fBIcons\fP tag. Within this tag,
zero or more \fBIconPath\fP tags may be specified. The text of this tag is
assumed to be an absolute directory path to a directory containing XPM icons.
When searching for icons, if multiple paths are provided, they will be
searched in order until a match is made.
